## Overview

Exprimental fischertechnik RC vehicle project using an ESP32-based gamepad for control. The project includes code for both the ESP32 gamepad and the fischertechnik TXT controller to enable remote operation of the vehicle.

## ATTENTION: **Very important notes**

- The AI should always provide **VERY SHORT ANSWERS** and avoid long explanations at all costs. **TWO VERY SHORT PARAGRAPHS** is the limit, each one with just one sentence.
- The AI should try at all cost to make **MINIMAL** changes to existing code, avoiding adding new functions, excessive checking, abstractions or refactoring (unless absolutely necessary).
- In fact, the AI should make efforts to **REDUCE** code size whenever possible, removing unused code, simplifying logic, and avoiding duplication. Your task is to make the codebase as small and efficient as possible.
- I'm not in a hurry. I prefer to wait for high-quality, elegant code instead of quick fixes that I have to Undo and Redo many times.
